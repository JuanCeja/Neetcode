// We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

// I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

// Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

// You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

// -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
// 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
// 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
// Return the number that I picked.

// Example 1:
// Input: n = 10, pick = 6
// Output: 6

// Example 2:
// Input: n = 1, pick = 1
// Output: 1

// Example 3:
// Input: n = 2, pick = 1
// Output: 1

const guessNumber = (n) => {
    let start = 1, end = n;

    while (start <= end) {
        let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
        let guessNum = guess(mid);

        if (guessNum === 0) return mid;
        else if (guessNum === 1) start = mid + 1;
        else if(guessNum === -1) end = mid - 1;
    }
};

console.log(guessNumber(10, 6)); // 6
console.log(guessNumber(1, 1)); // 1
console.log(guessNumber(2, 1)); // 2
