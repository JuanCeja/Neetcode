// You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

// The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

// Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

 

// Example 1:
// Input: grid = 
// [
//     [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
//     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
//     [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
//     [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
//     [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
//     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
//     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
//     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
// ]
// Output: 6
// Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

// Example 2:
// Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
// Output: 0

};

const explore = (r, c, grid, count) => {
    // if element is out of bounds of is equal to 0 return

    // add to count

    // explore all directions
